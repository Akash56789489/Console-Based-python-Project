# 🏧 Console-Based ATM System in Python

This is a simple console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) project written in Python. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as **withdrawal**, **deposit**, **PIN generation**, **PIN change**, and **balance enquiry**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 PIN generation for new users
- 🔁 PIN change option for existing users
- 💰 Deposit money into the account
- 💸 Withdraw money from the account
- 📊 Check current account balance
- ❌ Input validation and basic error handling

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Console-based input/output

No external libraries required — pure Python!

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
atm_project/
├── atm.py            # Main script containing the ATM logic
├── users.json        # (Optional) Stores user data such as PIN and balance
├── README.md         # Project documentation
You may choose to store user data in-memory or in a simple JSON/text file.

📌 Notes
This is a basic simulation of ATM functionalities and is not connected to a real bank database.

You can expand it by integrating databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL) or using OOP concepts.

💡 Future Enhancements
Add user registration and account number features

Use OOP design for better modularity

Add transaction history tracking

Add GUI using Tkinter or web interface using Flask/Django
